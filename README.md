# Mail

This is a node CLI for sending out mail with attachments, only supports gmail ATM or the other top contenders.

## Reasons

Because can and I always get confused when I try to fool around with the mail protocol for unix; this made me sad so I wrote a CLI in something I know I can configure without dropping the ball.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Add gmail user and pass in the config/config.json
3. Change personal.json to config.json index.js
4. npm install -g, run `mail` and you're off
